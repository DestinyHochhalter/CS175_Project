# Closet-App

# Overview
Closet App saves your entire closet in one place and generates custom clothing recommendations. Currently we support the profile page where your entire closet will be displayed in categories such as recent, tops, bottoms, accessories, outwear, and footwear. The profile page also displays collections you make. The explore page is also supported, where clothing recommendations are generated based on clothes in your closet and items you have previously liked.

# MVP
Our product currently supports user login and authentication, the profile page, and explore page. The user login in fully implemented and user account information is stored in Firebase. Clothing saved to the users profile page are also stored on Firebase. The userinterface is fully implemented, however, there is currently no functionality to manually upload clothing items or create custom collections.

# Upcoming Development
In the next sprints we plan to implement the prprietary functinality of our product - an email scraping feature to identify purchased clothing. This feature makes using the app effortless as there is no manual uploading required. We will also support manual uploads, creating collections, and interactions with other accounts. Interactions with other accounts will include supporting following others, liking posts, and commenting on posts.
