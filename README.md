# Closet-App

## Overview
Closet App saves your entire closet in one place and generates custom clothing recommendations. Our app provides an effortless solution to find fashion inspiration you like based on your own stye. This is done by scraping your email to find purchased clothing, and adding those clothes to your 'closet' in the app. We make finding fashion inspiration effortless with our curated clothing recommendations based on clothes in your 'closet' and app interaction. Currently we support the profile page where your entire closet will be displayed in categories such as recent, tops, bottoms, accessories, outwear, and footwear. The profile page also displays collections you make. The explore page is also supported, where your clothing recommendations are displayed.

## MVP
Our product currently supports user login and authentication, the profile page, and explore page. The user login in fully implemented and user account information is stored in Firebase. Clothing saved to the user's profile page is also stored on Firebase. The user interface is fully implemented, however, there is currently no functionality to manually upload clothing items or create custom collections.

## Upcoming Development
In the next sprints we plan to implement the proprietary functinality of our product - an email scraping feature to identify purchased clothing. This feature makes using the app effortless as there is no manual uploading required. We will also support manual uploads, creating collections, and interactions with other accounts. Interactions with other accounts will include supporting following others, liking posts, and commenting on posts.
